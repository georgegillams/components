# Navigation Bar

## Scroll position

Note: If using this, you should add `scroll-padding-top: calc(${navigationBarHeight} + ${spacingLg});` to your HTML styles so that anchor links take the user slightly further down the page. This will allow for the nav bar height.

## Props

Logo will automatically be wrapped in a `li` tag in wide viewports, and left as is for narrow viewports.

All navigation items should already be wrapped in `li` tags.

The provided NavigationItem with this component does this for you.
